# Use DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs with cURL

This tutorial uses cURL to demonstrate working with the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM.

For the tutorial we will use the DICOM files here: [Sample DICOM files](../dcms). The file name, studyUID, seriesUID and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files is as follows:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|

> NOTE: Each of these files represent a single instance and are part of the same study. Also green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs, you must have an instance of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM deployed. If you have not already deployed the Medical Imaging Server, [Deploy the Medical Imaging Server to Azure](../quickstarts/deploy-via-azure.md).

Once you have deployed an instance of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, retrieve the URL for your App Service:

1. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for **App Services** and select your Medical Imaging Server for DICOM App Service.
1. Copy the **URL** of your App Service.

For this code, we'll be accessing an unsecured dev/test service. Please don't upload any private health information (PHI).


## Working with the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM 
The DICOMweb&trade; standard makes heavy use of `multipart/related` HTTP requests combined with DICOM specific accept headers. Developers familiar with other REST-based APIs often find working with the DICOMweb&trade; standard awkward. However, once you have it up and running, it's easy to use. It just takes a little finagling to get started.

The cURL commands each contain at least one, and sometimes two, variables that much be replaced. To simplify running the commands, do a search and replace for the following variables, replacing them with your specific values:

* {service-name} : the name of your App Service (without the `.azurewebsites.net`), such as `mydicomserver`
* {path-to-dicoms} : path to the directory which contains the red-triangle.dcm file, such as `C:/dicom-server/docs/dcms`
    * Be sure to use forward slashes as separators and end the directory _without_ a trailing forward slash.

## Uploading DICOM Instances (STOW)
---
### Store-instances-using-multipart/related

This request intends to demonstrate how to upload DICOM files using multipart/related. 

> NOTE: The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM is more lenient than the DICOM standard. The example below, however, demonstrates a POST request that complies tightly to the standard.

_Details:_

* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * `Accept: application/dicom+json`
    * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* Body:
    * `Content-Type: application/dicom` for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value

> Some programming languages and tools behave differently. For instance, some require you to define your own boundary. For those, you may need to use a slightly modified Content-Type header. The following have been used successfully.
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related`

`curl --location --request POST "http://{service-name}.azurewebsites.net/studies" --header "Accept: application/dicom+json" --header "Content-Type: multipart/related; type=\"application/dicom\"" --form "file1=@{path-to-dicoms}/red-triangle.dcm;type=application/dicom" --trace-ascii "trace.txt"`

---

### Store-instances-for-a-specific-study

This request demonstrates how to upload DICOM files using multipart/related to a designated study. 

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies/{study}
* Method: POST
* Headers:
    * `Accept: application/dicom+json`
    * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"`
* Body:
    * `Content-Type: application/dicom` for each file uploaded, separated by a boundary value

> Some programming languages and tools behave differently. For instance, some require you to define your own boundary. For those, you may need to use a slightly modified Content-Type header. The following have been used successfully.
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; type="application/dicom"; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related; boundary=ABCD1234`
 > * `Content-Type: multipart/related`

`curl --request POST "http://{service-name}.azurewebsites.net/studies/1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420" --header "Accept: application/dicom+json" --header "Content-Type: multipart/related; type=\"application/dicom\"" --form "file1=@{path-to-dicoms}/blue-circle.dcm;type=application/dicom"`

---

### Store-single-instance

> NOTE: This is a non-standard API that allows the upload of a single DICOM file without the need to configure the POST for multipart/related. Although cURL handles multipart/related well, this API allows tools like Postman to upload files to the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM.

The following is required to upload a single DICOM file.

_Details:_
* Path: ../studies
* Method: POST
* Headers:
   *  `Accept: application/dicom+json`
   *  `Content-Type: application/dicom`
* Body:
    * Contains a single DICOM file as binary bytes.

`curl --location --request POST "http://{service-name}.azurewebsites.net/studies" --header "Accept: application/dicom+json" --header "Content-Type: application/dicom" --data-binary "@{path-to-dicoms}/green-square.dcm"`
