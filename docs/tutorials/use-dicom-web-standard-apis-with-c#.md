# Use DICOMweb&trade; Standard APIs with C#

This tutorial uses C# to demonstrate working with the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM.

For the tutorial we will use the DICOM files here: [Sample DICOM files](../dcms). The file name, studyUID, seriesUID and instanceUID of the sample DICOM files is as follows:

| File | StudyUID | SeriesUID | InstanceUID |
| --- | --- | --- | ---|
|green-square.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.12714725698140337137334606354172323212|
|red-triangle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395|
|blue-circle.dcm|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.77033797676425927098669402985243398207|1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13273713909719068980354078852867170114|

> NOTE: Each of these files represent a single instance and are part of the same study. Also green-square and red-triangle are part of the same series, while blue-circle is in a separate series.

## Prerequisites

In order to use the DICOMWeb&trade; Standard APIs, you must have an instance of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM deployed. If you have not already deployed the Medical Imaging Server, [Deploy the Medical Imaging Server to Azure](../quickstarts/deploy-via-azure.md).

Once you have deployed an instance of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, retrieve the URL for your App Service:

1. Sign into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1. Search for **App Services** and select your Medical Imaging Server for DICOM App Service.
1. Copy the **URL** of your App Service.

In your application install the following nuget packages:

1.  [Dicom Client](https://microsofthealthoss.visualstudio.com/FhirServer/_packaging?_a=package&feed=Public&package=Microsoft.Health.Dicom.Client&protocolType=NuGet)
2.  [fo-dicom](https://www.nuget.org/packages/fo-dicom/)

## Create a `DicomWebClient`

After you have deployed your Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, you will create a 'DicomWebClient'. Run the following code snippet to create `DicomWebClient` which we will be using for the rest of the tutorial. Ensure you have both nuget packages mentioned above installed.

```c#
string webServerUrl ="{Your DicomWeb Server URL}"
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
httpClient.BaseAddress = new Uri(webServerUrl);
IDicomWebClient client = new DicomWebClient(httpClient);
```

With the `DicomWebClient` we can now perform Store, Retrieve, Search, and Delete operations.

## Store DICOM Instances (STOW)

Using the `DicomWebClient` that we have created, we can now store DICOM files.

### Store single instance

This demonstrates how to upload a single DICOM file.

_Details:_

* POST /studies

```c#
DicomFile dicomFile = await DicomFile.OpenAsync(@"{Path To blue-circle.dcm}");
DicomWebResponse response = await client.StoreAsync(new[] { dicomFile });
```

### Store instances for a specific study

This  demonstrates how to upload a DICOM file into a specified study.

_Details:_

* POST /studies/{study}

```c#
DicomFile dicomFile = await DicomFile.OpenAsync(@"{Path To red-triangle.dcm}");
DicomWebResponse response = await client.StoreAsync(new[] { dicomFile }, "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420");
```

Before moving on to the next part also upload the green-square.dcm file using either of the methods above.

## Retrieving DICOM instance(s) (WADO)

The following code snippets will demonstrate how to perform each of the retrieve queries using the `DicomWebClient` created earlier.

The following variables will be used throghout the rest of the examples:

```c#
string studyInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.13230779778012324449356534479549187420"; //StudyInstanceUID for all 3 examples
string seriesInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.45787841905473114233124723359129632652"; //SeriesInstanceUID for green-square and red-triangle
string sopInstanceUid = "1.2.826.0.1.3680043.8.498.47359123102728459884412887463296905395"; //SOPInstanceUID for red-triangle
```

### Retrieve all instances within a study

This retrieves all instances within a single study.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveStudyAsync(studyInstanceUid);
```

All three of the dcm files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study so the response should return all 3 instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all three instances are returned.

### Use the retrieved instances

The following code snippet shows how to access the instances that are retrieved, how to access some of the fields of the instances, and how to save it as a .dcm file.

```c#
DicomWebAsyncEnumerableResponse<DicomFile> response = await client.RetrieveStudyAsync(studyInstanceUid);
await foreach (DicomFile file in response)
{
    string patientName = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.PatientName);
    string studyId = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.StudyID);
    string seriesNumber = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.SeriesNumber);
    string instanceNumber = file.Dataset.GetString(DicomTag.InstanceNumber);

    file.Save($"<path_to_save>\\{patientName}{studyId}{seriesNumber}{instanceNumber}.dcm");
}
```

### Retrieve metadata of all instances in study

This request retrieves the metadata for all instances within a single study.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveStudyMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid);
```

All three of the dcm files that we uploaded previously are part of the same study so the response should return the metadata for all 3 instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that all the metadata is returned.

### Retrieve all instances within a series

This request retrieves all instances within a single series.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveSeriesAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid);
```

This series has 2 instances (green-square and red-triangle), so the response should return both instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that both instances are returned.

### Retrieve metadata of all instances within a series

This request retrieves the metadata for all instances within a single study.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveSeriesMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid);
```

This series has 2 instances (green-square and red-triangle), so the response should return metatdata for both instances. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that both instances metadata are returned.

### Retrieve a single instance within a series of a study

This request retrieves a single instances.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series{series}/instances/{instance}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveInstanceAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid);
```

This should only return the instance red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the instance is returned.

### Retrieve metadata of a single instance within a series of a study

This request retrieves the metadata for a single instances within a single study and series.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/metadata

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveInstanceMetadataAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid);
```

This should only return the metatdata for the instance red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the metadata is returned.

### Retrieve one or more frames from a single instance

This request retrieves one or more frames from a single instance.

_Details:_

* GET /studies/{study}/series/{series}/instances/{instance}/frames/{frames}

```c#
DicomWebResponse response = await client.RetrieveFramesAsync(studyInstanceUid, seriesInstanceUid, sopInstanceUid, frames: new[] { 1 });

```

This should return the only frame from the red-triangle. Validate that the response has a status code of OK and that the frame is returned.
