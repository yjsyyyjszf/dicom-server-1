## Configure deployment settings

Configure the remaining deployment settings for your Medical Imaging Server. The default settings are appropriate for an excellent dev/test or proof-of-concept environment as they are inexpensive, yet perform well for small to medium loads. For a production environment, upgrading to regionally redundant storage, failover databases and autoscaling application servers is recommended.

Refer to [Configure Medical Imaging Server for DICOM](../how-to-guides/configure-dicom-server-settings.md) for more configuration instructions.
