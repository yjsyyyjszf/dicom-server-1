# Health Check API

The Health Check API allows user to check the health of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM and all the underlying services.

## API Design

The Health Check API exposes a GET endpoint and responds with JSON content.

Verb | Route              | Returns     
:--- | :----------------- | :---------- 
GET  | /health/check      | Json Object 

## Object Model

The GET request returns a JSON object with the following fields:

Field         | Type   | Description
:------------ | :----- | :----------
overallStatus | string | Status `Healthy` or `Unhealthy`
details       | array  | Array of objects with details on underlying services

Objects of the `details` array have the following model:

Field         | Type   | Description
:------------ | :----- | :----------
name		  | string | Name of the service
status		  | string | Status `Healthy` or `Unhealthy`
description   | string | Description of the status

## Get Health Status

Internally, the Microsoft.Extensions.Diagnostics.HealthChecks NuGet package is used for getting the health status. Its documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/microsoft.extensions.diagnostics.healthchecks?view=dotnet-plat-ext-3.1).

To check the health status of Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, the user issues a GET request to /health/check. Following is a sample JSON response if all the underlying services are healthy:
```
{
	"overallStatus":"Healthy",
	"details":
	[
		{
			"name":"DicomBlobHealthCheck",
			"status":"Healthy",
			"description":"Successfully connected to the blob data store."
		},
		{
			"name":"MetadataHealthCheck",
			"status":"Healthy",
			"description":"Successfully connected to the blob data store."
		},
		{
			"name":"SqlServerHealthCheck",
			"status":"Healthy",
			"description":"Successfully connected to the data store."
		}
	]
}
```

Healthy (HTTP Status Code 200) is returned as the overall status if all the underlying services are healthy. If any of the underlying services are unhealthy, overall status of the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM will be returned as unhealthy (HTTP Status Code 503).

Following is an example JSON if SQL Server service is unhealthy:
```
{
	"overallStatus":"Unhealthy",
	"details":
	[
		{
			"name":"DicomBlobHealthCheck",
			"status":"Healthy",
			"description":"Successfully connected to the blob data store."
		},
		{
			"name":"MetadataHealthCheck",
			"status":"Healthy",
			"description":"Successfully connected to the blob data store."
		},
		{
			"name":"SqlServerHealthCheck",
			"status":"Unhealthy",
			"description":"Failed to connect to the data store."
		}
	]
}
```

Details array in the response contains details of all the services and their health status.
